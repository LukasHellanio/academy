## Features

- **Custom UI Components**: Focus on clean design, user-friendly interactions, and easy navigation. The UI includes custom avatars, icons, and completion percentage indicators for each team.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Implements Firebase Auth for secure user login and authentication. Includes a login page and manager dashboard with real-time user authentication.
